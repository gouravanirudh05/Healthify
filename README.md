This healthcare platform is a modern, scalable web application designed to provide users with an engaging and personalized healthcare management experience. The platform is built using a full-stack architecture with the latest technologies to ensure a responsive, high-performance user interface and robust backend functionality.

At its core, the platform combines React.js for dynamic frontend development, Node.js and Express.js for building fast, scalable server-side APIs, and MongoDB for a flexible and efficient database solution. It also leverages the OpenStreetMap API for geolocation-based features, enhancing user accessibility and convenience.

### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Landing Page**:Displays a map of nearby hospitals using device location, powered by OpenStreetMap API.
- **Dynamic Blogs**: Health blogs are generated dynamically to provide up-to-date and relevant health information.
- **Chatbot Integration**: Users can interact with a chatbot to discuss health-related issues.

- **User Dashboards**:
    * **Patient Dashboard**: View appointments, profiles, and reports.
    * **Doctor Dashboard**: Manage appointments and patient records. 
    * **Admin Dashboard**: Oversee platform operations and user managemen
- **Secure Login and Registration**: Separate registration for patients and doctors.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Users can schedule appointments seamlessly.
- **Real-Time Data Synchronization**: Leveraging **MongoDB** for real-time updates on patients reports and patient-doctor interactions.

### Technology Stack:
- **Frontend**: 
  - **React.js**: Dynamic and responsive user interface.
  - **TailWinD CSS**: simplifies styling and custom designs, making the interface visually appealing and easy to maintain.
- **Backend**:
  - **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that powers the backend, enabling asynchronous, non-blocking I/O for high scalability.
  - **Express.js**: A minimalist web framework for Node.js, providing robust tools for creating RESTful APIs and handling HTTP requests efficiently.
  
- **Database**: 
  - **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that allows for flexible, schema-less data storage, ideal for storing user profiles, progress data, and course content.
- **API**:  
    * **OpenStreetMap API**: Used to display nearby hospitals based on user location, utilizing device geolocation.  
    * **Gemini API**: Powers the chatbot functionality, providing intelligent responses to user health-related queries.  
    * **NewsAPI**: Fetches the latest health-related news articles dynamically for the blog section.  
    * **MongoDB Atlas API**: Serves as the backend database for storing user data, appointments, and reports securely.  
    * **Browser Geolocation API**: Retrieves the user's current location to enable personalized map views and proximity-based hospital listings.  
    * **Custom REST APIs**: Built with Node.js and Express.js for managing user authentication, profile management, appointment scheduling, and report generation.  


### Workflow & Interaction:

1. **Sign-In/Sign-Up**: Users can sign up and log in via secure authentication. Once logged in, their data, including appointments, profiles, and health records, is securely persisted across sessions.

2. **Dynamic Map on Landing Page**: Upon logging in, users are greeted with a dynamic map powered by the OpenStreetMap API, which displays nearby hospitals and healthcare facilities based on their device's location.

3. **Dynamic Health Blogs**: Users can access dynamically generated health blogs that provide insights into various medical topics and health tips. The content is updated regularly to keep users informed.

4. **Integrated Chatbot Assistance**: The platform includes a chatbot designed to assist users with health-related queries in real time, offering a personalized and interactive experience.

5. **User Role-Based Dashboards**:

    * Patients:

      * Schedule and manage appointments easily through a user-friendly interface.

      * View and download health reports directly from their dashboard.

      * Update and maintain their personal profile details.

    * Doctors:

      * Manage and track appointments efficiently.

      * Access and review patient details and reports.

      * Communicate with patients via integrated tools.

    * Admins:

      * Oversee platform operations, including user and content management.

      * Monitor overall activity and ensure smooth functioning of the system.

      * Schedule Appointments: The platform offers a seamless appointment scheduling system where users can book appointments with doctors based on availability.

7. **Real-Time Data Updates**: All changes made by users (appointments, reports, or profile updates) are instantly synchronized with the backend to provide a consistent and updated user experience.

This platform combines a powerful backend with an interactive front-end to create a scalable, robust, and user-friendly healthcare solution. It has been designed to support the growing needs of patients, healthcare professionals, and administrators, ensuring a seamless experience for all.

  ```
* Install MongoDB : https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/

### Getting all the requried API Keys for your project:
To run this project, you need to create .env files in both the frontend and backend directories and include the respective API keys. Below are the steps to obtain the required API keys and configure them properly.

1. #### **Setting up the environment file in frontend**:
 ```
 touch .env
 ```
Inside `.env` add the following variables
```
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
VITE_NEWS_API_KEY=your_news_api_key_here
```
Steps to obtain the API keys:

1. Gemini API key:
   * Visit <a href="googlestudio.com">Google AI studio</a>
